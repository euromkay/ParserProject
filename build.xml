Instructions for using Eclipse to work on the project:

1. Copy the starterCode from the public/ directory to a desired location
2. Copy this build.xml from the public directory into your starterCode
3. Make a new directory in your starterCode called "lib"
4. Copy the javacup jar (~/../public/Tools/java-cup-v11a.jar) into the "lib" directory
5. In Eclipse, select File > New > Java Project
    (A) Uncheck the box for "Use default location"
    (B) Click Browse to select your starterCode directory
    (C) Change the "Project name" to something else
    (D) Click Finish
5. Go to your Project Properties (right-click on project then Properties or Project > Properties)
    (A) Select Builders from the list on the left
    (B) Click New...
        (a) Select Ant Builder
        (b) Change the name to Parser Builder
        (c) Click Browse Workspace for the "Buildfile" section and just choose the build.xml in your project
        (d) Click Browse Workspace for the "Base directory" section and just choose your main project directory
        (e) Go to the Refresh tab and check the "Refresh resource upon completion" checkbox
             - And select "The project containing the selected resource"
        (f) Go to the Targets tab and set "Auto Build" and "Clean" to the targets "compile" and "clean", respectively
        (g) Click OK
     (C) Now, in the list of builders, select the newly created Parser Builder and move it up one, above the Java Builder
     (D) Click OK, and you should see the javacup parser run automatically (and anytime you update rc.cup)
6. Right-click on rc.cip in the list of files in Eclipse, and select Open With > Text Editor.
7. Change something in rc.cup and save it, to test that things are working.
8. The starterCode project should now have no errors (maybe harmless warnings though)
9. RUNNING: In Eclipse, select Run > Run Configurations...
   (A) From the list, double-click Java Application
   (B) Rename this config to "RC"
   (C) For "Project", just click Browse and select your project
   (D) For "Main class", click Browse and select the RC class from the list
   (E) Click on the Arguments tab
       (a) For the Program arguments section, click the Variables... button
       (b) From the list, choose "string_prompt" and click OK
       (c) Now change it to look like this (you can copy and paste this in):
            ${string_prompt:name of .rc file to compile:.rc}
       (d) Click Run
       (e) When you get the prompt for .rc file, type in example.rc (a file in the starterCode)
       (f) Click OK. You should see "Compile: success"!
